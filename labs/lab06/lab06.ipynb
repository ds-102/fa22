    "1. Navigate to Kernel > Restart & Run All. Ensure that all public test cases pass locally. \n",
    "2. Save your notebook under File > Save and Checkpoint. If you do not save your notebook, then you might run into issues with the downloaded .zip file.\n",
    "3. Run the very last cell, which generates a .zip file for you to download to your local machine. Click the “here” button to download the .zip file. You may receive an error that the .zip file was unable to be created because there was an issue with PDF generation. You need to ensure that you’ve answered all of the questions that require a manual response.\n",
    "4. If your work downloads as several independent files rather than as a .zip, you are likely using Safari on a Mac. Follow these instructions to make sure you can download your work as a zip: https://macreports.com/how-to-download-zip-files-without-unzipping/\n",

Similarly, we have the same information for the high-MPG cars (above `M`). A good value of `M` will make the mean squared residuals for the two groups as small as possible. So, at each node, we choose a split that makes the mean squared error on each side as small as possible.\n",
