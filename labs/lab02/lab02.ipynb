    "**NOTE: This lab will be submitted using an auto-grader. Therefore, the submission instructions for this lab are different than before.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit the lab: \n",
    "1. Navigate to Kernel > Restart & Run All. Ensure that all public test cases pass locally. \n",
    "2. Save your notebook under File > Save and Checkpoint. If you do not save your notebook, then you might run into issues with the downloaded .zip file.\n",
    "3. Run the very last cell, which generates a .zip file for you to download to your local machine. Click the “here” button to download the .zip file. You may receive an error that the .zip file was unable to be created because there was an issue with PDF generation. You need to ensure that you’ve answered all of the questions that require a manual response.\n",
    "4. If your work downloads as several independent files rather than as a .zip, you are likely using Safari on a Mac. Follow these instructions to make sure you can download your work as a zip: https://macreports.com/how-to-download-zip-files-without-unzipping/\n",
    "5. Upload this .zip to the correct assignment on Gradescope. After submitting, the autograder built-in to the Gradescope assignment will tell you which public test cases you’ve passed and failed. There are no hidden test cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first question looks at a medical diagnostic decision. For each person that undergoes testing, the null hypothesis is that they don't have the virus, and the alternative is that they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "_The null hypothesis_ $H_0$: Person $X$ does not have the virus.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose that you devise a test which takes some measurements from each test subject and then computes a corresponding p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we looked at several approaches for controllling False Positive Rate (FPR), Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) and False Discovery Rate (FDR). However, they all have some drawbacks for medical decision making: FPR and FWER do not depend on the prevalence of the disease and neither of them allows a decision maker to consider different misclassification costs arising from false-negative and false-positive diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making medical decisions, wrong diagnoses carry different costs. Deciding that a patient does not have the virus when in reality they do is a **False Negative**. The potential consequences of such a decision are severe: lack of treatment, risk of infecting others, and even premature death.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, deciding that a patient has the virus when in reality they don't is a **False Positive**. The potential consequences of that include distress, unnecesary treatment and costs of subsequent testing. This is certainly not ideal, but less severe than the consequences of a false negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've previously evaluated decisions in terms of their TPR and FPR, and showed how ROC curves demonstrate the trade-off curve between the two quantities. We saw that it is not always clear how to choose the best trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very popular way of choosing the trade-off, and simultaneously comparing different procedures, is the idea of **risk** that we learnt in Lecture 5. Here, the analyst constructs a loss function by specifying the **cost** of making each type of mistake.\n"
