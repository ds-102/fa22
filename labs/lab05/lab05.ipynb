You may receive an error that the .zip file was unable to be created because there was an issue with PDF generation. You need to ensure that you’ve answered all of the questions that require a manual response.\n",

In fact, we don't even know what distribution the $X_i$ are drawn from, only that it's unimodal (under the null hypothesis)!
