    "Recall that in a randomized experiment, we make treatment decisions completely at random. This prevents the treatment from being confounded by any external factors - if it was assigned completely at random then treatment cannot be correlated with unobserved variables. Unfortunately, in an observational study, we often must deal with confounders: variables that are correlated with both the treatment and the outcome. Mathematically, in a randomized experiment, we say that\n",

    "meaning that knowing any unit's treatment status doesn't give us any additional information about the distribution of their potential outcomes (\"what-ifs\"). For example, in a drug trial, because of randomization, the people who receive the drug have the same (distribution of) potential outcomes as the people who receive a placebo, since there are no systematic differences between the treatment and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an observational study, this usually isn't true. For example, suppose we are interested in the effect of a job training program on income. People who receive the job training program might be poorer than people who don't, and so whether they receive the training or not, their incomes might be lower. Therefore, the confounding effect of socioeconomic status will cause the simple difference in means to be biased. If we observe socioeconomic status, then we can use various strategies to correct for it to recover the true causal effect of job training programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea, that we observe all confounding varaibles so we can correct for them, is called **unconfoundedness**. Stated mathematically, the treatment and potential outcomes are *conditionally* independent given a set of known confounding variables $X$:\n",

Some other popular names for unconfoundedness include: \"exogeneity\" (economics), \"selection on observables\" (statistics), and \"ignorability\" (medicine)."

    "For this lab, you'll be working with data from a job training program in the mid-1970s called the National Supported Work Demonstration. The data (and the results we'll reproduce) come from a famous 1986 paper by Robert LaLonde, [Evaluating the Econometric Evaluations of Training Programs](https://business.baylor.edu/scott_cunningham/teaching/lalonde-1986.pdf). Here's a description of the program from the original paper (emphasis added):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW) was a temporary employment program designed to help disadvantaged workers lacking basic job skills move into the labor market by giving them work experience and counseling in a sheltered environment. Unlike other federally sponsored employment and training programs, the NSW program **assigned qualified applicants to training positions randomly**. Those assigned to the treatment group received all the benefits of the NSW program, while those assigned to the control group were left to fend for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few more important excerpts from the paper, describing the participants and data collected (links added):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The MDRC admitted into the program [AFDC women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_to_Families_with_Dependent_Children), ex-drug addicts, ex-criminal offenders, and high school dropouts of both sexes. For those assigned to the treatment group, the program guaranteed a job for 9 to 18 months, depending on the target group and site. The treatment group was divided into crews of three to five participants who worked together and met frequently with an NSW counselor to discuss grievances and performance...\n",
    "\n",
    "> The type of work even varied within sites. In particular, male and female participants frequently performed different sorts of work. The female participants usually worked in service occupations, whereas the male participants tended to work in construction occupations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The MDRC collected earnings and demographic information from both the treatment and the control group at baseline and every nine months thereafter. MDRC also conducted up to four post-baseline interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to estimate the causal effect of the training program on income. Specifically, we will compare the income of people in 1974, 1975 (before the training program) with their income in 1978 (after the program). \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like LaLonde did, we'll start by evaluating the randomized experiment. Then, we'll look at what would happen if we didn't have a control group, and instead had to use data from an observational study."
