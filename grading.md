title: "Grading Policies"
---

Our goal in teaching this class is to help you learn the material. Our grading policies are based on this goal: we’ll provide you with feedback on your learning in homework and lab, and the rest of our policies are meant to further this goal as well.

## Assignments

You will be assessed through the following assignments:

* (about) 14 weekly vitamins
* (about) 14 weekly discussion worksheets
* 6 homework assignments
* 12 lab assignments
* 2 midterms
* 1 final project


## Grades

Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:

* Vitamins: 5%
* Discussion worksheet/attendance: 5%
* Homeworks: 20%
* Labs: 15%
* Midterm 1: 20%
* Midterm 2: 20%
* Final project: 15%

### Grading criteria

* Vitamins are weekly short assignments to check that you are keeping up with lectures. Vitamins should take fewer than 15 minutes to complete. Your two lowest vitamin scores will be dropped.
* Discussion worksheets will be graded on completion (credit/no-credit). You may miss three discussion worksheets without penalty to overall discussion grade.
* Homework will be graded on completion and correctness. No assignment may be dropped, but we have a slip day policy (see below).
* Lab assignments will be graded on completion and correctness, but all test cases for autograded questions will be public. Your two lowest lab scores will be dropped.
* When submitting assignments on Gradescope, **you must match each page to the corresponding question on Gradescope**. If you fail to do so, you may not receive credit for your work!
* A grading rubric and more details regarding the final project will be released later in the semester.

## Regrade requests
* After each assignment is graded, course staff will post the deadline for regrade requests for that assignment on Ed.
* To ensure that our grading team is not overworked, **regrade requests for each assignment must be submitted before the deadline** (except in cases of emergencies).
* Note: When you submit a regrade request, we will take a fresh look at the question, so it is possible that you will receive a grade lower that what you originally received.

## Exams

There will be two midterms on October 6, 2022, and November 17, 2022. Midterms will be held from 7-9PM. You must take the midterm at the specified time: if you have a conflict, please contact course staff ASAP at data102@berkeley.edu. **We will not accept any conflicts after the drop deadline** (except for emergencies).

<!--The exams will be proctored, and will tentatively be held in person. Any remote exams will also be proctored, using a protocol similar to CS161.-->

Exams will be held in person. Further information will be communicated in due course.

## Slip Days

Each student gets an extension budget of 5 total slip days. You can use the extension on homework assignments only (not lab assignments, weekly vitamins, or the final project) during the semester. Some important notes on slip days:
* **Do not plan to use your slip days**: we're providing them for unforeseen circumstances.
* **Slip days are self-serve**: we'll apply them to your assignments automatically.
* **Slip days are full days, not hours.** We round up, so if you are 1 hour late, then 1 slip day will be used. (Why? We’d rather you get some sleep and make an attempt to finish the assignment the next day instead of staying up to micromanage hours.)
* After you have used your slip-time budget, any assignment handed in late will be marked off 20% per day late (rounded up to the nearest integer number of days).
* No assignment will be accepted more than 5 days late.

We know that we’re still in an unprecedented global pandemic and economic downturn: **If you have already used up your 5 slip days in the semester** and you are facing extenuating circumstances or unusual hardship, you can contact us for extra accomodations. We’re here to help you learn!

For information on DSP accommodations, please refer to the course Ed site.

DSP students eligible to receive extensions on assignments will have homeworks due 48 hours after the posted deadline. Labs and vitamins will be due 24 hours after the posted deadline.


## Collaboration Policy

Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Keep in mind that content from the homeworks and labs will likely be covered on both of the midterms. We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, so be sure you are familiar with it.

## Waitlist

If you are on the waitlist, you should complete and submit all assignments as if enrolled: we will not offer any makeup assignments for waitlisted students.

## We Want You to Succeed

If you are feeling overwhelmed, visit our office hours and talk with us. We know college can be stressful and we want to help you succeed!

## Campus Honor Code

As a member of the Berkeley community, we expect you to follow the Berkeley Honor Code:

“As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”
